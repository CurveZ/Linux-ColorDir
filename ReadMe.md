# ColorDir - A Colorful Directory Listing Tool for Linux

ColorDir is a Linux command-line tool that provides a colorful and emoji-enhanced directory listing, inspired by the classic HDIR tool for DOS. It categorizes files by type and displays them with appropriate colors and icons for better visual clarity.

           !!About ColorDir. v. beta 0.3
```
This program lists directory contents with color coding.

**History**:  
About 30 years ago, I discovered HDIR, a simple tool that brought color to my directory listings in DOS.  
I loved it then, and today, I set out to create a tribute to it: ColorDir.  
Not as a replacement for `ls` and its deeper functionalities, but as both a nostalgic homage and an aesthetically pleasing way to view files, wrapped in the colors of the past.

## Features

- **Color-coded file types**: Different colors for programming files, text files, videos, pictures, compressed files, executables, and more.
- **Emoji support**: Adds emojis to represent file types and directories.
- **Recursive listing**: Option to list files and directories recursively.
- **Human-readable sizes**: Displays file and directory sizes in a readable format (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
- **Multi-column view**: Automatically adjusts to terminal width for a compact display.
- **Customizable patterns**: Supports wildcard patterns (`*`, `?`) for filtering files.
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of invalid directories and unknown flags.

## Installation

To install, run the following command:

```bash
sudo wget -O /c https://kervels.net/colordir/c && sudo chmod a+rx /c
```

## Usage

```bash
c [flags] [directory] [pattern]
```

### Flags

- `-l, --list`       Force list view.
- `-w, --wide`       Force columns view.
- `-t, --total`      Display total size of directories and subdirectories.
- `-r, --recursive`  Recursive listing.
- `-p, --pause`      Pause after each screen of output.
- `-h, --help`       Display help information.

### Examples

1. List all files in the current directory (default):
   ```bash
   c
   ```

2. List all files recursively with detailed listing:
   ```bash
   c -r -l
   ```

3. List `.txt` files in a specific directory:
   ```bash
   c /user/docs "*.txt"
   ```

4. List files recursively in wide format:
   ```bash
   c -r -w
   ```

5. List files containing an `x`:
   ```bash
   c "*[x]*"
   ```

6. List files that do not contain a number:
   ```bash
   c "*[!0-9]*"
   ```

## Tested Systems

- Developed and tested on **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**.  
- Likely compatible with other Linux distributions.

## To-Do

### Short-Term Goals

- Improve error handling:
  - Handle permission errors gracefully.
  - Ensure accurate file size retrieval.
- Visual feedback:
  - Display a red line above the summary when an error occurs.
  - Log detailed errors to the system journal.
  - Add explanation of journal usage in the `--help` section.
- Pattern matching:
  - Scan inside directories for matching files and folders, even if the directory name itself does not match the search pattern.
- `-p` flag:
  - Review or refine behavior as needed.
- Emoji support in filenames:
  - Investigate and adjust string handling for emoji characters.

### Long-Term Goals

- Windows version.
- macOS compatibility.
- WSL support or dedicated version.
