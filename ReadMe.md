# ColorDir - A Colorful Directory Listing Tool for Linux

ColorDir is a Linux command-line tool that provides a colorful and emoji-enhanced directory listing, inspired by the classic HDIR tool for DOS. It categorizes files by type and displays them with appropriate colors and icons for better visual clarity.

## History:  
About 30 years ago, I discovered HotDIR (hdir.com), a simple tool that brought color to my directory listings in MS-DOS. I loved it then, and today, I set out to create a tribute to it: ColorDir. Not as a replacement for `ls` or its deeper functionalities, but as both a nostalgic homage and an aesthetically pleasing way to view files, wrapped in the colors of the past.
